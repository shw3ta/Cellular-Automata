This repository contains all work done for the final project in Theory of Computation, a course offered by Mahavir Jhawar in Spring 2020. 
You can find the associated webapp here: [cellular-automata](https://share.streamlit.io/shw3ta/cellular-automata/main/webapp/Automata.py).
You can find the final project report here: [report](https://github.com/shw3ta/cellular-automata/blob/main/documents/CS_2349___Theory_of_Computation__Final_Report.pdf).

Test vectors generated using the `generate_iv.py` scripts are not in this repository since the files are too big for GitHub.
